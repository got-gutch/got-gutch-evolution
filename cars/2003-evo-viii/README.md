In May 2003, two men from Yonkers, NY, were killed while spectating at the Ski Sawmill ClubRally in Pine Township, Pennsylvania.

- During the third stage of the race, a Subaru Impreza WRX driven by Peter P. Malaszuk became airborne after cresting a rise.
- The car bounced off a boulder and struck a tree where the two men were standing; both were pronounced dead at the scene.

The Evo 8 was purchased new by Peter Smith, in December 2003 I bought the car from Peter Smith's wife for $24,000, it 
had 1200 miles on the odometer.

## This Evo 8

Before I bought this car I thought my Eclipse GST was fast, but the Evo 8 was in a different league. The car was bone 
stock and had a very aggressive sound to it. I removed the stock airbox and replaced it with e K&N Typoon cold air intake, 
which made the car sound even better.

I used the car as a daily driver from 2004 to 2014 then put it in my garage. I started it every month or two to keep the fluids circulating.
But, after the motor in my 2017 Ford Focus RS died 10 2025, I decided to start tuning the Evo 8.

The idea is to create a car that doesn't have large HP numbers on paper, but is very responsive and fun to drive. I want 
to be able to drive the car hard on the street without worrying about reliability or traction issues. But, I also want to 
be able to take the car to the hard packed gravel or snow covered roads of PA and have fun there too.
